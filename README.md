**`Cognitive Science`**

Welcome to my Github profile ![wave-gif](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Readme-Workflows/Readme-Icons@main/icons/gifs/wave.gif)

My background is in Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience, where I have mostly specialised in sensory perception and EEG signal processing. Aside from academia, I have pursued data science projects to improve my programming skills, to work with real world data (Spotify API) and to explore nice methods for data storage on cloud servers.

I use Github to showcase some of my projects, collaborate with others, and share code with other scientists.

### Projects
Through my background in cognitive neuroscience, and personal expeditions in data science methods, I have gained strong skills in programming (Python, MATLAB, R), web scraping, database storage (MySQL, BigQuery) and querying (SQL), statistics, data analytics, data visualisation, and oral presentation.

In this portfolio, I showcase my cognitive/data science skills through 4 separate projects. My description of the projects are brief as code and figures can be found in their corresponding repositories.
#### *Project 1: Auditory oddball experiment*
* Cleaned dataset by following a standard EEG preprocessing protocol - removal of artifacts (ECG, eyeblinks), bandpass filtering to remove line noise, removing noisy trials and channels, removing independent components that were non-signal related, interpolating any removed bad channels.
* Performed time-series and time-frequency analyses of event-related signals.
* Visualised the results of intricate statistical analyses using ***MATLAB and Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn, MNE)***.
* The results of this project indicate that pre-attentive neural responses to environmental irregularities become heightned in chronic pain patients to compensate for attentional deficits.
* Detailed description, code and figures can be found at the following [repository](https://github.com/columose/Chronic-Pain-Project.git).

#### *Project 2: Colour surface perception*
* Cleaned dataset using standard EEG protocol (see project 3).
* Performed spectral analyses of frequency-tagged ERPs and visualised the results of statistical tests using ***MATLAB***.
* Presented findings of research study at a national conference.
* The figures below capture the findings of our study quite nicely. Illusory 'filling-in' of surfaces occurs with a 'spreading-out' of cortical activity. 
* For access to the complete thesis and poster, see the following [repository](https://github.com/columose/Colour-Perception.git).
