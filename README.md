**`Data science`**

Welcome to my Github profile ![wave-gif](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Readme-Workflows/Readme-Icons@main/icons/gifs/wave.gif)

I was introduced to data science through my work in biosignal processing of EEG data at academic institutions. This work required rigor to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio through multiple cleaning steps, an analytical mind for data science, hypothesis testing, and a sharp eye for results visualisation.

Aside from academia, I have pursued data science projects in my spare time to test and learn new programming languages, work with different types of real-world data (Spotify, Earthquakes, Animal Health), and test nice ways of storing data on local and cloud servers.

 I use Github to showcase some of my projects, collaborate with others, and share code with other data scientists.

### Data analytics portfolio
Through my background in data science and cognitive neuroscience, I have gained strong skills in programming (Pyhton, MATLAB), web scraping, database storage (MySQL, BigQuery) and querying (SQL), statistics, data analytics, data visualisation, and oral presentation.

In this portfolio, I showcase my data science skills through 4 separate projects. My description of the projects are brief as code and figures can be found in their corresponding repositories.

#### *Project 1: Auditory oddball experiment*
* Cleaned dataset by following a standard EEG preprocessing protocol - removal of artifacts (ECG, eyeblinks), bandpass filtering to remove line noise, removing noisy trials and channels, removing independent components that were non-signal related, interpolating any removed bad channels.
* Performed time-series and time-frequency analyses of event-related signals.
* Visualised the results of intricate statistical analyses using MATLAB and Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn, MNE).
* The results of this project indicate that pre-attentive neural responses to environmental irregularities become heightned in chronic pain patients to compensate for attentional deficits.
* Detailed description, code and figures can be found at the following [repository](https://github.com/columose/Chronic-Pain-Project.git).

#### *Project 2: World Organisation of Animal Health dataset*
* Extracted real-world data relating to *Foot and Mouth disease (FMD)* in animals from the *World Organisation of Animal Health's* public database.
* Cleaned the dataset by removing duplicate entries, Nan values, etc (Pandas).
* Stored clean dataset on MySQL server.
* Performed time-series analysis to determine when peaks in variables of interest occurred and further explored whether variables of interest appeared to be related (NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
* Deployed regression models to determine that FMD outbreaks in Europe have been dealt with by increased culling rates (scikit-learn).
* Summarised key metrics using interactive dashboard in [Tableau public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/colum.s./viz/WOAHFMDproject/Dashboard).
* Detailed description, code, figures, and interpretation can be found at the following [repository](https://github.com/columose/WOAH-FMD-dataset.git).

#### *Project 3: Earthquake datset from Google Cloud's BigQuery*
* Queried *BigQuery* database to extract an earthquake dataset using SQL.
* Cleaned the dataset my removing duplicate entries, Nans, etc (Pandas).
* Performed regression analyses to determine whether damage in millions of dollars could predict death rates (scikit-learn, Seaborn).
* More details on SQL queries, python scripts, and figures can be found at the following [repository](https://github.com/columose/SQL-BigQuery-.git).

#### *Project 4: Colour surface perception*
* Cleaned dataset using standard EEG protocol (see project 1).
* Performed spectral analyses of frequency-tagged ERPs and visualised the results of statistical tests using MATLAB.
* Presented findings of research study at a national conference.
* The figures below capture the findings of our study quite nicely. Illusory 'filling-in' of surfaces occurs with a 'spreading-out' of cortical activity. 
* For access to the complete thesis and poster, see the following [repository](https://github.com/columose/Colour-Perception.git).
