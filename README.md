**`Cognitive Neuroscience/Data science`**

Welcome to my Github profile ![wave-gif](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Readme-Workflows/Readme-Icons@main/icons/gifs/wave.gif)

My background is in Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience, with a strong focus on biosignal processing. I'm especially interested in the influence of prediction and attention on sensory perception.

My past labs have collected electrophysiological data in humans while they performed experiments. After this, I would clean any noise from the signals to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio, analyse data, perform statistical analyses, and present results in visual format.

 I use Github to showcase some of my projects, collaborate with others, and share code with other cognitive neuroscientists.

### Data analytics portfolio
Through my experience in cognitive neuroscience and separate side projects, I have gained strong skills in programming (MATLAB, Python, SQL), statistics, data analytics, data visualisation, and oral presentation.

In this portfolio, I showcase my data analytics skills through 4 separate projects. My description of the projects are brief as code and figures can be found in their corresponding repositories.

#### *Project 1: Auditory oddball experiment*
* Cleaned dataset by following a standard EEG preprocessing protocol - removal of artifacts (ECG, eyeblinks), bandpass filtering to remove line noise, removing noisy trials and channels, removing independent components that were non-signal related, interpolating any removed bad channels.
* Performed time-series and time-frequency analyses of event-related signals.
* Visualised the results of intricate statistical analyses using MATLAB and Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn, MNE).
* The results of this project indicate that pre-attentive neural responses to environmental irregularities become heightned in chronic pain patients to compensate for attentional deficits.
* Detailed description, code and figures can be found at the following [repository](https://github.com/columose/Chronic-Pain-Project.git).

#### *Project 2: World Organisation of Animal Health dataset*
* Extracted real-world data relating to *Foot and Mouth disease (FMD)* in animals from the *World Organisation of Animal Health's* public database.
* Cleaned the dataset by removing duplicate entries, Nan values, etc (Pandas).
* Performed time-series analysis to determine when peaks in variables of interest occurred and further explored whether variables of interest appeared to be related (NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
* Deployed regression models to determine that FMD outbreaks in Europe have been dealt with by increased culling rates (scikit-learn).
* Detailed description, code, figures, and interpretation can be found at the following [repository](https://github.com/columose/WOAH-FMD-dataset.git).

#### *Project 3: Earthquake datset from Google Cloud's BigQuery*
* Queried *BigQuery* database to extract an earthquake dataset using SQL.
* Cleaned the dataset my removing duplicate entries, Nans, etc (Pandas).
* Performed regression analyses to determine whether damage in millions of dollars could predict death rates (scikit-learn, Seaborn).
* More details on SQL queries, python scripts, and figures can be found at the following [repository](https://github.com/columose/SQL-BigQuery-.git).

#### *Project 4: Colour surface perception*
* Cleaned dataset using standard EEG protocol (see project 1).
* Performed spectral analyses of frequency-tagged ERPs and visualised the results of statistical tests using MATLAB.
* Presented findings of research study at a national conference.
* The figures below capture the findings of our study quite nicely. Illusory 'filling-in' of surfaces occurs with a 'spreading-out' of cortical activity. 
* For access to the complete thesis and poster, see the following [repository](https://github.com/columose/Colour-Perception.git).
