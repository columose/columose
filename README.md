**`Cognitive Neuroscience/Data science`**

Welcome to my Github profile ![wave-gif](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Readme-Workflows/Readme-Icons@main/icons/gifs/wave.gif)

My background is in Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience, with a strong focus on electrical signal processing. I'm especially interested in the influence of prediction and attention on sensory perception.

My past labs have collected electrophysiological data in humans while they performed experiments. After this, I would clean any noise from the signals to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio, analyse data, perform statistical analyses, and present results in visual format.

 I use Github to showcase some of my projects, collaborate with others, and share code with other cognitive neuroscientists.

## Data analytics portfolio
Through my experience in cognitive neuroscience and separate side projects, I have gained strong skills in programming (MATLAB, Python, SQL), statistics, data analytics, data visualisation, and oral presentation.

In this portfolio, I showcase my data analytics skills through 4 separate projects. My description of the projects are brief as code and figures can be found in their corresponding Github repositories.

### Project 1: Auditory oddball experiment
This is the largest scale data analytics project that I carried out at my last lab, having spent 6 months from cleaning the raw data to presenting my results in visual and oral format. 

You can find more details about the project at the following [repository](https://github.com/columose/Chronic-Pain-Project.git)
