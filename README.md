**`Cognitive Neuroscience/Data science`**

Welcome to my Github profile ![wave-gif](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Readme-Workflows/Readme-Icons@main/icons/gifs/wave.gif)

My background is in Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience, with a strong focus on biosignal processing. I'm especially interested in the influence of prediction and attention on sensory perception.

My past labs have collected electrophysiological data in humans while they performed experiments. After this, I would clean any noise from the signals to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio, analyse data, perform statistical analyses, and present results in visual format.

 I use Github to showcase some of my projects, collaborate with others, and share code with other cognitive neuroscientists.

### Data analytics portfolio
Through my experience in cognitive neuroscience and separate side projects, I have gained strong skills in programming (MATLAB, Python, SQL), statistics, data analytics, data visualisation, and oral presentation.

In this portfolio, I showcase my data analytics skills through 4 separate projects. My description of the projects are brief as code and figures can be found in their corresponding repositories.

#### *Project 1: Auditory oddball experiment*
This is the largest scale data analytics project that I carried out at my last lab, having spent 6 months from cleaning the raw data to presenting my results in visual and oral format. 

You can find more details about the project at the following [repository](https://github.com/columose/Chronic-Pain-Project.git)

#### *Project 2: World Organisation of Animal Health dataset*
Having gained ample experience with signal processing in MATLAB, I decided that it was time to develop my Python skills to a greater extent. I undertook a project on a public-access dataset from the World Organisation of Animal Healthcare on foot and mouth disease. The project saw me clean the raw dataset, analyse the data, visualise my results, and present the findings at this [repository](https://github.com/columose/WOAH-FMD-dataset.git)

#### *Project 3: Colour surface perception*
I carried out a colour perception project during my Master's degree to investigate the surface, edge, and filling-in mechanisms that enable surface completion. The project served as a great introduction to signal processing, programming, and project management. The result of the project are presented in a Master's thesis and poster at the following [repository](https://github.com/columose/Colour-Perception.git)

#### *Project 4: Earthquake datset from Google Cloud's BigQuery*
I undertook this small project to apply some newly learned SQL skills for data extraction from the BigQuery public database. Subsequently, I cleaned, analysed and visualised the dataset in Python. More details can be found at the following [repository](https://github.com/columose/SQL-BigQuery-.git)
